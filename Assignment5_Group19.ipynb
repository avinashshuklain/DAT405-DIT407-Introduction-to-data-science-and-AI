    "### Markov Decision Processes\n",
    "Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making under uncertainty. An *agent* moves between *states* in a *state space* choosing *actions* that affects the transition probabilities between states, and the subsequent *rewards* recieved after a jump. This is then repeated a finite or infinite number of epochs. The objective, or the *solution* of the MDP, is to optimize the accumulated rewards of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an MDP consists of five parts: \n",

    "* Decision epochs: $t={1,2,...,T}$, where $T\\leq \\infty$\n",
    "* State space: $S=\\{s_1,s_2,...,s_N\\}$ of the underlying environment\n",
    "* Action space $A=\\{a_1,a_2,...,a_K\\}$ available to the decision maker at each decision epoch\n",
    "* Transition probabilities $p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$ for jumping from state $s_t$ to state $s_{t+1}$ after taking action $a_t$\n",
    "* Reward functions $R_t = r(a_t,s_t,s_{t+1})$ resulting from the chosen action and subsequent transition\n",
    "\n",
    "A *decision policy* is a function $\\pi: s \\rightarrow a$, that gives instructions on what action to choose in each state. A policy can either be *deterministic*, meaning that the action is given for each state, or *randomized* meaning that there is a probability distribution over the set of possible actions for each state. Given a specific policy $\\pi$ we can then compute the the *expected total reward* when starting in a given state $s_1 \\in S$, which is also known as the *value* for that state, \n",

    "\n",
    "where $a_t = \\pi(s_t)$. To ensure convergence and to control how much credit to give to future rewards, it is common to introduce a *discount factor* $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$. For instance, if we think all future rewards should count equally, we would use $\\gamma = 1$, while if we value near-future rewards higher than more distant rewards, we would use $\\gamma < 1$.

Recall that for a policy to be optimal, it must satisfy the Bellman equation above, meaning that plugging in a given candidate $V^*$ in the right-hand side (RHS) of the Bellman equation should result in the same $V^*$ on the left-hand side (LHS). This property will form the basis of our algorithm. Essentially, it can be shown that repeated application of the RHS to any intial value function $V^0(s)$ will eventually lead to the value $V$ which statifies the Bellman equation. Hence repeated application of the Bellman equation will also lead to the optimal value function. We can then extract the optimal policy by simply noting what actions that satisfy the equation.    "

    "## Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Theory for optional question 3)\n",
    "Until now, we understood that knowing the MDP, specifically $p(s'|a,s)$ and $r(s,a,s')$ allows us to efficiently find the optimal policy using the value iteration algorithm. Reinforcement learning (RL) or decision making under uncertainity, however, arises from the question of making optimal decisions without knowing the true world model (the MDP in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have defined the value function for a policy through $V^\\pi$. Let's now define the *action-value function*\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q^\\pi(s,a) = \\sum_{s'} p(s'|a,s) [r(s,a,s') + \\gamma V^\\pi(s')]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value function and the action-value function are directly related through\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^\\pi (s) = \\max_a Q^\\pi (s,a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e, the value of taking action $a$ in state $s$ and then following the policy $\\pi$ onwards. Similarly to the value function, the optimal $Q$-value equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q^*(s,a) = \\sum_{s'} p(s'|a,s) [r(s,a,s') + \\gamma V^*(s')]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the relationship between $Q^*(s,a)$ and $V^*(s)$ is simply\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^*(s) = \\max_{a\\in A} Q^*(s,a).$$\n",

    "#### Q-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning is a RL-method where the agent learns about its unknown environment (i.e. the MDP is unknown) through exploration. In each time step *t* the agent chooses an action *a* based on the current state *s*, observes the reward *r* and the next state *s'*, and repeats the process in the new state. Q-learning is then a method that allows the agent to act optimally. Here we will focus on the simplest form of Q-learning algorithms, which can be applied when all states are known to the agent, and the state and action spaces are reasonably small. This simple algorithm uses a table of Q-values for each $(s,a)$ pair, which is then updated in each time step using the update rule in step $k+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{k+1}(s,a) = Q_k(s,a) + \\alpha \\left( r(s,a) + \\gamma \\max \\{Q_k(s',a')\\} - Q_k(s,a) \\right) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma$ is the discount factor as before, and $\\alpha$ is a pre-set learning rate. It can be shown that this algorithm converges to the optimal policy of the underlying MDP for certain values of $\\alpha$ as long as there  is sufficient exploration. For our case, we set a constant $\\alpha=0.1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenAI Gym\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall use already available simulators for different environments (worlds) using the popular [OpenAI Gym library](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/). It just implements different types of simulators including ATARI games. Although here we will only focus on simple ones, such as the **Chain enviroment** illustrated below.\n",
    "![alt text](https://chalmersuniversity.box.com/shared/static/6tthbzhpofq9gzlowhr3w8if0xvyxb2b.jpg)\n",
    "The figure corresponds to an MDP with 5 states $S = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and two possible actions $A=\\{a,b\\}$ in each state. The arrows indicate the resulting transitions for each state-action pair, and the numbers correspond to the rewards for each transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3 (optional)\n",
    "You are to first familiarize with the framework of [the OpenAI environments](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/), and then implement the Q-learning algorithm for the <code>NChain-v0</code> enviroment depicted above, using default parameters and a learning rate of $\\gamma=0.95$. Report the final $Q^*$ table after convergence of the algorithm. For an example on how to do this, you can refer to the Q-learning of the **Frozen lake environment** (<code>q_learning_frozen_lake.ipynb</code>), uploaded on Canvas. Hint: start with a small learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the NChain environment is not available among the standard environments, you need to load the <code>gym_toytext</code> package, in addition to the standard gym:\n",

    "For a real world example of this, imagine two miners who have just found diaminds while digging in a spot. While it might be worth it to keep diging in this spot since they know it contains diamonds (Exploitation). It is also conceivable that if they split up and one of them goes exploring for other digging spots they might find another even better spot that is bigger and has other gems as well. While this is a risk in the short term, it is still very probable that it will be worth it in the long run."

    "**Answer 5a:** Decision trees are a type of algorithm used to classify or predict outcomes based on data. At each step of the algorithm, we split the data into two or more branches based on certain features. We can use measurements like Gini Impurity or Entropy to help us decide which features to use for the splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are a type of algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make better predictions. It's like having a group of people work together to make a decision instead of just one person. With random forests, we take the output of many different decision trees and then average them to get the final prediction. This can help us get more accurate predictions because it reduces the chance of errors caused by one decision tree.\n",

    "In a decision tree, each step of the algorithm is like asking a question about the data. The answer determines which branch to follow next, until we reach a leaf that gives us a label or prediction."

    "**Answer 5b:** Random forests are a machine learning algorithm that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. This helps to reduce the chance of making mistakes, because the different trees work together to find the best answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of using random forests is that they are less likely to be overfit than a single decision tree. Overfitting happens when the algorithm fits the training data too closely, and this can lead to poor performance on new data. By using many different trees, random forests are better at generalizing to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using many trees also means that random forests can be slow to train, and require more computational power than a single tree. This is a trade-off between accuracy and speed, and it's up to the user to decide which is more important for their application."
